## Background

SouthWind started with the launch of 'Jin Mu Nan Feng'. In the process of promoting 'Jin Mu Nan Feng', we found that we needed a website that could meet the following characteristics:

- Well organized with large amounts of text
- Adaptive or responsive
- Searchable by keyword

As a result, we built a static website and deployed it to GitHub Pages. In April 2018, we started developing version 1.0 of the project based on HTML. In May 2019, we started developing version 2.0 of the project based on VuePress. In August 2021, we started developing version 2.1 of the project based on VuePress 2.
